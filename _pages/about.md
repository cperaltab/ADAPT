ADAPT is a project designed to support the fundamental need to enable adopting best practices in marine observing strategies, managing data, and synthesizing outcomes. Its core goal is to provide training and support local monitoring programs. 

The ADAPT project seeks to promote the adoption and adaptation of standardized practices and methodologies within the Caribbean region to suit their capabilities and regional context in terms of monitoring and managing their marine territories and resources, while maintaining interoperability of ocean observations and data. 

The ADAPT project is supported by funding under the Programme Cooperation Agreement between NORAD and UNESCO and its partners institutions: Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras, Colombia ([INVEMAR] (https://www.invemar.org.co/es/web/guest/inicio)), and the St. Georgeâ€™s University ([SGU] (https://sgu.digication.com/bec-sgu/overview)), Department of Biology, Ecology and Conservation, Grenada, West Indies.
