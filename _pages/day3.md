## Module 1: Coastal Habitat and Biodiversity Assessment: Standards and Data Publication

## • 8:00-8:45

Continue form day 2. Brief introduction to the fundamental concepts already covered in the online material shared during the pre-course assignment.

**Outline of the learning objectives:** 

_Note: Add hyperlinks to each of the theoretical contents sources delivered during the pre-course assignment (pdf? Drive docs?)_

1. From field data collection to dataset assembly (rock shore)
2. Data annotation tools
3. Generating an occurrence table and share it to OBIS

**Activities**

Classroom, hands on, working with data collected in the field (OBIS dataset template)

Following the pre-course assignments, review OBIS data standards, formatting and QC.

Data annotation, data set creation. Focus on higher taxonomic hierarchies, e.g. Mollusks, Macroalgae, Cnidaria (Discuss with the local trainers what are the most common taxonomic groups, or which are key functional groups  in each location and have a list before hand to help the annotation process move faster)
