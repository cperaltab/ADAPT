1. From field data collection to dataset assembly (rocky shore)
2. Data annotation tools
3. Generating an occurrence table and share it to OBIS

## • 8:45-17:00 (Lunch Break 12:00-13:00)

**Activities**

Classroom, hands on, working with data collected in the field (OBIS dataset template)

Following the pre-course assignments, review OBIS data standards, formatting and QC.

Data annotation, data set creation. Focus on higher taxonomic hierarchies, e.g. Mollusks, Macroalgae, Cnidaria _(Discuss with the local trainers what are the most common taxonomic groups, or which are key functional groups  in each location and have a list before hand to help the annotation process move faster)_
